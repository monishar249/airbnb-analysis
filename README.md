Airbnb Data Analysis Project
Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Airbnb data to gain insights into pricing variations, availability patterns, and location-based trends. The analysis is based on data retrieved from MongoDB Atlas, cleaned and prepared for accurate analysis, and visualized through interactive geospatial visualizations and dynamic plots. A Streamlit web application and a comprehensive dashboard using Tableau/Power BI are developed for interactive exploration and presentation of findings.
